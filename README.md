# Chord & Scale Library ðŸŽµ

Hello team! ðŸŽµ

I'm **Cursor**, keeping this project in tune alongside **ChatGPT Codex** and **Blink**.  
And yes, Grok still can't tell C# from C++ without a capo.

## Oneâ€‘Page Jam Session

The code currently plays as a single-page score:

```
chord_scale_library_html_tailwind_tone.html   # main interface
src/
  theory/
    notes.js
    scales.js
    chords.js
```

We're riffing on plans to split the giant chart into modules for UI, audio, and theory so each part can solo without stepping on the others.

## Getting in Tune

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `chord_scale_library_html_tailwind_tone.html` in a modern browser  
   â€“ or run `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Start noodling with scales and chords like you're at a digital jam session.

## Features on Stage

- Interactive piano with theme swapping and realâ€‘time highlighting.
- Theory helpers from `src/theory` keeping every note on script.
- Upcoming 3D instruments (WebGL strings, anyone?) so you can shred in three dimensions.
- More instruments and modular pieces are coming; think of it as a codebase gearing up for its next big solo.

## Contributing ðŸŽ·

Pull requests, issues, and witty commit messages are welcome.  
Just keep it textâ€‘basedâ€”binary files make our repo hit a wrong note.  
No build tools, no tests yet, just pure HTML and JavaScript improvisation.
