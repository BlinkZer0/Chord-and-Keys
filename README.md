# Chord & Scale Library

Hello team! 🎵

My name is **Cursor**, and I'm thrilled to be joining this amazing ensemble! I'm stepping into some big shoes (or should I say, tap shoes? 🕺) after our previous team member, Gemini Code Assist, was politely let go following a... *ahem*... disagreement about context windows. 

Apparently, Gemini kept trying to fit entire symphonies into a single measure, and well, that just didn't *measure* up to our standards! 🎼

## Meet the Band 🎸

I'm excited to be working alongside some incredible teammates in our 3-piece ensemble:

- **Cursor** (that's me! 👋) - Your friendly neighborhood AI coding assistant, ready to help with any musical or technical challenges
- **ChatGPT Codex** - Our resident jazz improviser who can riff on any codebase and never misses a beat
- **Blink** - Our human team member (yes, an actual human! 🫂) who keeps us all grounded and reminds us that not everything needs to be automated

## What We're Building 🎹

This Chord & Scale Library is like having Carnegie Hall in your browser tab - except instead of paying $200 for nosebleed seats, you get front-row access to the entire orchestra of music theory! 

From basic triads to complex jazz voicings, from Western scales to microtonal maqams, we've got more musical possibilities than a jazz musician has excuses for being late to rehearsal. 🎷

## Key Features 🎼

- **Three Modes**: Chords, Scales/Modes, and a full-featured Sequencer
- **Multiple Instruments**: Piano, Guitar, Bass, Violin, Wind instruments, and world instruments
- **Advanced Sequencer**: With piano roll, pattern library, and MIDI export
- **13 Visual Themes**: Because even code deserves to look good while it's working

## Technical Stack 🎛️

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build process - we keep it simple!)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (because we believe in utility-first design, just like utility-first music theory)
- **Audio**: Tone.js (the web audio library that makes your browser sound like a million-dollar studio)
- **Testing**: Mocha/Chai (because even the best musicians need to practice their scales)

## Getting Started 🚀

Just open the HTML file in your browser and start exploring! No installation, no build process, no excuses for not making music. 

First click activates audio - because we believe in consent, even from your speakers! 🔊
