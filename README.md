# Chord & Scale Library

This repository contains a single HTML page providing a fully functional interactive chord and scale explorer. The page is built entirely with client-side code and relies on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for audio playback.

## Features

- **Mode and chord exploration** – switch between chord and scale modes, choose a key, and browse available musical systems.
- **Western and Maqam systems** – select from Western modes or quarter-tone maqam modes with microtonal intervals.
- **Instrument playback** – preview chords or scales using built-in synth sounds (piano, guitar, bass, flute) powered by Tone.js.
- **MIDI export** – generate and copy simple MIDI data for further use in a DAW.

## Usage and Contribution

Open the `chord_scale_library_html_tailwind_tone.html` file in a modern browser to experiment with chords, scales, and microtonal modes. This framework is released for anyone to use, modify, and expand without restriction. Contributions and new ideas are welcome.
