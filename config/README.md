# Configuration Files

This folder contains configuration and dependency files for the Chord and Keys project.

## Files

### package.json
Contains project metadata and dependencies for the Node.js/npm ecosystem. This file is used by:
- Package managers (npm, yarn) to install dependencies
- Build tools to understand project configuration
- Development tools for project information

## For Users

If you're a novice user, you don't need to worry about these files. They are automatically managed by the development tools and package managers.

## For Developers

If you need to modify project dependencies or configuration:
1. Edit the appropriate file in this folder
2. Run the necessary commands to apply changes
3. Test that everything still works correctly

## Installation

If you're setting up the project for development:
```bash
cd config
npm install
```

The main application file (`Chord and key.html`) is in the root directory and can be opened directly in a web browser.
