# QoL Improvements & Production Mode Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines all the Quality of Life (QoL) improvements and Production Mode features implemented in the Chord & Scale Library.

## üéØ QoL Improvements

### 1. **Empty State Handling**

  - Welcome message with emoji and clear instructions
  - "Add Sample Note" button to quickly add a middle C note
  - "Import Pattern" button to load a basic drum pattern
  - Automatic detection of empty state and UI updates

### 2. **Enhanced Grid Visibility**
- **Problem**: Grid lines become invisible at different zoom levels
- **Solution**: Implemented SVG-based grid overlay system
- **Features**:
  - SVG grid that scales properly at all zoom levels
  - Dashed lines for better visibility
  - Proper opacity and stroke settings
  - Responsive to zoom changes

### 3. **Better Scrollbar Styling**
- **Problem**: Default scrollbars are ugly and don't match the theme

  - Matching colors with the dark theme
  - Hover effects for better UX
  - Cross-browser compatibility (WebKit + Firefox)

### 4. **Responsive Design Improvements**
