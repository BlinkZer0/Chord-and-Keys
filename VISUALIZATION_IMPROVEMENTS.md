# Audio Visualization Improvements

## Overview
The spectrum and spectrogram visualizations in the Chord & Keys application have been significantly improved and properly implemented. These visualizations now provide real-time audio analysis with enhanced visual feedback and better performance.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Spectrum Visualization (FFT)
- **Frequency-based color mapping**: Colors now correspond to actual frequencies (blue for low frequencies, red for high frequencies)
- **Improved visual design**: Added gradient background and glow effects for stronger frequencies
- **Frequency labels**: Added frequency markers (100Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz) for better readability
- **Better amplitude scaling**: Improved conversion from dB to amplitude with proper scaling
- **Enhanced bar rendering**: Better bar width calculation and visual appearance

### 2. Proper Spectrogram Implementation
- **Time-frequency representation**: Now properly displays frequency content over time
- **Data accumulation**: Maintains historical frequency data for time-domain visualization
- **Color-coded intensity**: Frequency content is color-coded with intensity based on amplitude
- **Time markers**: Added time markers along the bottom for temporal reference
- **Frequency labels**: Added frequency labels on the left side for frequency reference
- **Memory management**: Limited spectrogram width to prevent memory issues

### 3. Improved Analyzer Setup
- **Proper analyzer configuration**: Uses appropriate FFT size and type for each visualization mode
- **Error handling**: Added proper error handling and logging for analyzer setup
- **Mode switching**: Properly handles switching between visualization modes
- **Audio context management**: Better integration with Tone.js audio context

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Smooth transitions**: Better handling of mode changes and state management
- **Visual feedback**: Improved visual feedback for all visualization modes
- **Performance optimization**: Optimized rendering for better frame rates
- **Responsive design**: Visualizations adapt to different canvas sizes

## Technical Details

### Analyzer Configuration
- **Waveform mode**: Uses 2048-point analyzer for time-domain visualization
- **Spectrum mode**: Uses 1024-point FFT for frequency-domain analysis
- **Spectrogram mode**: Uses 2048-point FFT for high-resolution frequency analysis

### Color Mapping
- **Spectrum**: Frequency-based HSL color mapping (240° blue to 0° red)
- **Spectrogram**: Same frequency-based mapping with intensity-based lightness
- **Waveform**: Classic blue waveform display

### Performance Features
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60fps rendering
- **Viewport culling**: Only renders visible data
- **Memory management**: Limits spectrogram data to prevent memory overflow
- **Error recovery**: Graceful handling of audio context issues

## Usage

### In the Main Application
1. Open the Chord & Keys application
2. Look for the visualizer panel in the top-right corner
3. Select visualization mode from the dropdown:
   - **Waveform**: Real-time amplitude display
   - **Spectrum**: Real-time frequency spectrum
   - **Spectrogram**: Time-frequency analysis
4. Use the size controls (Min/Small/Max) to adjust visualization size
5. Play music or use the sequencer to see the visualizations in action

### Test File
A standalone test file (`test_visualizations.html`) is provided for testing the visualizations independently. This file includes:
- Basic audio controls
- Test tone generation
- All three visualization modes
- Frequency slider for testing different frequencies

## Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support (requires user interaction to start audio)
- **Mobile browsers**: Limited support due to audio context restrictions

## Future Enhancements
- **3D visualizations**: Potential for 3D spectrum and spectrogram displays
- **Custom color schemes**: User-selectable color palettes
- **Advanced analysis**: Peak detection, harmonic analysis
- **Export capabilities**: Save visualization as images or videos
- **Real-time effects**: Audio effects based on frequency analysis

## Troubleshooting
- **No visualization**: Ensure audio context is started (click "Start Audio" in test file)
- **Poor performance**: Reduce canvas size or check for other audio applications
- **No audio input**: Check microphone permissions and audio routing
- **Visual artifacts**: May occur with very high sample rates or complex audio

## Dependencies
- **Tone.js**: Audio processing and analysis
- **Web Audio API**: Browser audio context
- **Canvas API**: 2D rendering
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth animation
