# Note Deletion Fix - AI Reference

## Problem
Notes continued playing after being deleted from the sequencer due to scheduled events remaining in Tone.Transport queue.

## Solution
Clear scheduled events and release all notes when deleting:

```javascript
// In deleteSelected(), Shift+Alt deletion, and seqClearAll
if(Tone.Transport.state==='started') {
  Tone.Transport.cancel(); // Clear scheduled events
  song.tracks.forEach(t => {
    if(t.player && t.player.releaseAll) {
      t.player.releaseAll(); // Stop playing notes
    }
  });
  scheduleSong(activeTrack); // Reschedule remaining notes
}
```

## Added Methods
- `releaseAll()` to all instrument types (synth, sampler, drums)
- Proper error handling for release operations

## Impact
- Notes stop playing immediately when deleted
- No orphaned scheduled events
- All instrument types properly handle cleanup
