# Visualization Fixes - Spectrum and Spectrum Peak

## Problem
The spectrum and spectrum peak visualizations were not displaying any audio information because the native Web Audio API analyzers weren't properly connected to the Tone.js audio graph.

## Root Cause
The original implementation used native Web Audio API `AnalyserNode` but failed to properly connect them to the Tone.js master bus output node, resulting in analyzers that received no audio data.

## Solution
Fixed the connection between native Web Audio API analyzers and the Tone.js audio system:

### 1. Proper Audio Graph Connection
```javascript
// Get the Tone.js master bus as a native Web Audio node
const masterBusNode = getMasterBus().output;

// Connect native analyzer to Tone.js output
_wa.analyser = ac.createAnalyser();
masterBusNode.connect(_wa.analyser);
```

### 2. Maintained Native Web Audio API Data Methods
```javascript
// Frequency data for spectrum visualizations
_wa.analyser.getByteFrequencyData(_wa.freq);
const mag = _wa.freq[i]/255;

// Time domain data for waveform visualizations
_wa.analyserL.getByteTimeDomainData(_wa.waveL);
const v = (_wa.waveL[i]-128)/128;
```

### 3. Audio Context Management
```javascript
function ensureAnalyser(){
  try{ 
    // Ensure audio context is started
    if(Tone.context.state !== 'running') {
      Tone.start().catch(e => console.warn('Could not start audio context:', e));
    }
    ensureAnalysers(); 
  } catch(e){ console.warn('Analyzer setup failed:', e); }
}
```

## Fixed Visualizations
All visualization modes now work correctly:

- ✅ **Waveform**: Real-time audio waveform display
- ✅ **Spectrum**: Real-time frequency spectrum with color-coded bars
- ✅ **Spectrum Peak**: Frequency spectrum with peak hold indicators
- ✅ **Spectrogram**: Time-frequency representation
- ✅ **Radial Bars**: Circular frequency display
- ✅ **Radial Wave**: Circular waveform display
- ✅ **Lissajous**: Stereo phase relationship
- ✅ **Particles**: Audio-reactive particle system
- ✅ **VU Meter**: Left/right channel level meters
- ✅ **Wave Scroll**: Scrolling waveform display

## Benefits
1. **Compatibility**: Uses native Web Audio API for maximum browser compatibility
2. **Performance**: Native analyzers are optimized by the browser
3. **Integration**: Properly connected to Tone.js audio graph
4. **Reliability**: Consistent data flow from audio engine to visualizations

## Technical Details

### Connection Architecture
```
Audio Sources → Tone.js Master Bus → Master Bus Output Node → Native Analyzers → Visualizations
```

### Data Flow
1. Audio is generated by Tone.js synthesizers
2. Audio flows through the Tone.js master bus
3. Master bus output node provides native Web Audio API connection point
4. Native analyzers receive audio data and process it
5. Visualizations read processed data using standard Web Audio API methods

## Usage
The visualizations now work automatically when:
1. Audio context is started (user interaction required)
2. Audio is playing through the sequencer
3. Visualization mode is selected from the dropdown

The spectrum and spectrum peak visualizations will now properly display real-time audio frequency information with color-coded bars and peak hold indicators.
